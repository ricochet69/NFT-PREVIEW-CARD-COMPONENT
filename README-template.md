## Overview

The challenge was to build a responsive NFT Preview Card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible using tools of my choosing.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I built the component using a mobile-first approach. I incorporated BEM methodology for class assignment and used CSS variable for key styles. I also used Flexbox to align key elements effectively.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to apply an overlay to a html element and animate the transition of it's opacity to produce a smoother effect when hovering and focusing over the main image of the card.

### Continued development

I'll begin attempting more complex designs by using a combination of Flexbox and Grid.
